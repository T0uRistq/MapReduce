24	Therefore God gave them up in the lusts of their hearts to impurity, to the dishonoring of their bodies among themselves,
25	because they exchanged the truth about God for a lie and worshiped and served the creature rather than the Creator, who is blessed forever! Amen.
26	For this reason God gave them up to dishonorable passions. For their women exchanged natural relations for those that are contrary to nature;
27	and the men likewise gave up natural relations with women and were consumed with passion for one another, men commiting shameless acts with men and receiving in themselves the due penalty for their error.
